# Hacker News Top Stories App

This is a React app that displays the top stories from Hacker News. It fetches the story details from the Hacker News API and renders them in a list.

# Start the kata

As a new developer on this application, your task is to complete the test coverage and ensure the app functions correctly. 

The previous developer has already started implementing some tests, but you will need to finish the job and add any additional tests as necessary.

Feel free to refactor the app as needed to improve its testability. Consider how you can structure the components and codebase to make it easier to write tests and ensure better test coverage.

## Clues

To help you with the task, consider the following:

What is the primary functionality of this app? Create a schema or outline of how the app should work to guide your testing efforts.

How can you refactor the app to improve its testability? Consider breaking down complex components, separating concerns, and using mocking or dependency injection to isolate dependencies for easier testing.

Your goal is to achieve comprehensive test coverage and ensure that the app functions correctly. Happy testing!

##  Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Install the dependencies

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
